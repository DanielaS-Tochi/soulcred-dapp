- [ ] IPFS hash returned
- [ ] File accessible via gateway

## Monitoring Setup

### Error Tracking

- [ ] Open browser console
- [ ] Type: `errorMonitor.getErrorStats()`
- [ ] Verify error monitoring is active

### Performance

- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit
- [ ] Target scores:
  - Performance: 90+
  - Accessibility: 100

- [ ] PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md reviewed
- [ ] Team briefed on error monitoring
- [ ] Support process established

## Backup & Recovery

- [ ] Supabase automatic backups enabled (default)
- [ ] Know how to rollback deployment (Netlify deploy history)
- [ ] LocalStorage fallback tested
- [ ] Emergency contact list ready

## User Communication
