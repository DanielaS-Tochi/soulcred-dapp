## 📞 Demo Q&A Preparation

### **Expected Questions**:

**Q: How is this different from digital certificates?**
A: Traditional digital certificates are centralized and can be revoked. SoulCred credentials are permanently stored on blockchain and owned by the user.

**Q: What prevents fake credentials?**
A: Community endorsements, issuer verification, and blockchain immutability make fraud extremely difficult.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Only gas fees for blockchain transactions (a few cents on testnets, ~$5-20 on mainnet).

**Q: Can credentials be transferred?**
A: No, they're "soulbound" - permanently tied to the recipient's wallet address.

**Q: What if someone loses their wallet?**
A: We have recovery mechanisms for legitimate cases, controlled by the contract owner.

**Q: How do you handle privacy?**
A: Users control what information to include. Sensitive data can be stored privately with only hashes on-chain.
