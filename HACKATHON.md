# SoulCred - Hackathon Submission

## üèÜ Project Overview

**SoulCred** is a decentralized platform for issuing and managing Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) that represent learning achievements and community contributions. Built during the Bolt.new hackathon, it demonstrates the power of Web3 technology in creating permanent, verifiable credentials.

## üéØ Hackathon Category

**Primary Category**: **Web3 & Blockchain**
- Implements Soulbound Tokens (ERC-721 based)
- Real blockchain integration with testnets
- IPFS decentralized storage
- Smart contract development

**Secondary Categories**:
- **Education & Learning**: Credential management for educational achievements
- **Social Impact**: Community-driven verification and reputation building
- **Developer Tools**: Comprehensive Web3 development stack

## ‚ú® Key Innovations

### 1. Soulbound Token Implementation
- **Non-transferable credentials**: Once minted, tokens are permanently bound to the recipient
- **Recovery mechanism**: Owner-controlled recovery for lost wallets
- **On-chain endorsements**: Peer verification system built into the smart contract

### 2. Decentralized Evidence Storage
- **IPFS integration**: All evidence files stored on decentralized network
- **Metadata standards**: OpenSea-compatible NFT metadata
- **Permanent accessibility**: Content remains available regardless of platform status

### 3. Community-Driven Verification
- **Peer endorsements**: Community members can endorse credentials
- **Reputation scoring**: Algorithm-based reputation system
- **Social proof**: Public achievement feed and user discovery

### 4. Advanced User Experience
- **Multi-step minting**: Guided credential creation process
- **File upload**: Drag-and-drop evidence upload with IPFS storage
- **Data visualization**: Interactive charts showing learning progress
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-first approach with dark/light themes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture
```solidity
contract SoulCredSBT is ERC721, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    // Soulbound implementation - prevents transfers
    // Credential data storage with impact metrics
    // Endorsement system with event logging
    // Recovery mechanism for lost wallets
}
```

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Wagmi & RainbowKit** for Web3 wallet integration
- **Tailwind CSS** for modern, responsive design
- **Recharts** for data visualization
- **React Dropzone** for file upload functionality

### Web3 Integration
- **Multiple testnets**: Sepolia, Goerli, Polygon Mumbai
- **IPFS storage**: Pinata integration for decentralized file storage
- **Real-time updates**: Live transaction status and confirmations
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback

## üöÄ Demo & Usage

### Live Demo
- **URL**: [https://soulcred-demo.netlify.app](https://soulcred-demo.netlify.app)
- **Test Network**: Sepolia Testnet
- **Wallet**: MetaMask required

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Connect Wallet**: Use MetaMask with Sepolia testnet
2. **Get Test ETH**: Use Sepolia faucet for gas fees
3. **Mint Credential**: Follow the 4-step guided process
4. **Explore Features**: View dashboard, endorse others, browse community

### Demo Credentials
Pre-populated with sample data to showcase:
- Learning progress visualization
- Achievement timeline
- Skills distribution
- Community endorsements

## üìä Impact & Metrics

### Problem Solved
- **Credential fraud**: Immutable, verifiable achievements
- **Centralized control**: Decentralized, user-owned credentials
- **Limited portability**: Universal, blockchain-based records
- **Lack of community verification**: Peer-driven endorsement system

### Target Audience
- **Students & Learners**: Showcase verified achievements
- **Educational Institutions**: Issue tamper-proof certificates
- **Employers**: Verify candidate credentials
- **Communities**: Build reputation-based networks

### Potential Impact
- **10M+ learners** could benefit from verifiable credentials
- **Educational institutions** can reduce fraud and administrative costs
- **Employers** get reliable skill verification
- **Communities** can build trust through transparent reputation
